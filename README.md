# Armada Backend

Armada's backend server is built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and
utilizes [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and the Amazon Web Services' (AWS)
[Software Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/) (SDK) to
communicate with all the pieces of Armada's architecture, including the
[Relational Database Service](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) (RDS), the
[Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html)
(ALB), the [Elastic Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) (ECS), and
more!
